## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

 - The only variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values was ground_clearance with a Pr(>ltl) value of 0.033. The Pr(>ltl) values of    all the other variables were not significant.

 - The slope of the linear model is not able to be determined due to this being a multiple linear regression.

 - This linear model does not predict the mpg of MechCar prototypes due to a P value of 0.1991, well over the allowed 5% variance. This means we are not able to      reject our null hypothesis. Additionally, the R squared value was 0.1223 meaning only around 12% of the variance can be explained by the regression.
